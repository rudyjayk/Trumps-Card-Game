# Trumps
4 players needed

Trumps is a fun partner vs partner game that influences competition and cooperation. It only requires 4 players and a standard deck of 52 cards. Trumps is similar to the known game of Spades but with the capabilities of changing the power that "Spades" hold in that game onto another suits by player choice. It allows players and teams to be strategic in how they play their hands and allows for flexibility in suits that Spades did not give.

## Setup

1. This card game can be played with a standard deck of 52 cards and also be played including jokers as well.
2. For setup, It requires only 4 players, the designated dealer deals the deck of cards in a clockwise fashion while leaving 4 cards(6 if played with jokers) on the side away from the 4 players hands.
3. Once each person has received a hand of cards the bidding process starts to see who receives the "Kitty" (which is the 4 cards (or 6) that was put on the side). 
4. Players are able to look at their cards once they receive them.
5. The bidding process goes like this:
- Left of dealer starts the bidding process
- Players are able to bid any number less than 8.
- The number the player bids must be larger than the current bid number.
- Players are able the pass if they feel they cannot beat the bid
- If only 1 player bids they are able to look at the Kitty without calling **trumps**
- Otherwise, players will need to call **trumps** before looking at Kitty
-The person who has the Kitty can use the 4 (or 6) cards that they have picked up and switch with cards in their hand, they must put down the same amount of cards that they picked up (either 4 or 6) in order for the game to be ready to start

## Gameplay

1. Once the bidding process is over and the winner of the Kitty has put down the correct number of cards the game is ready to start being played
2. Whoever picks up Kitty has to stop the opposing set of partners from making (8 - BidAmount) packs
3. To win a pack you or your partner must have the highest card in play unless you do not own any cards in the suit that is playing then you can use a **trump** card which beats any suit
4. Winner of Kitty starts by throwing the first card down and the turns go in a clockwise fashion
5. Main objective is for you or your partner to have the highest card or trump in play
6. Players must play the same suit that the first thrower plays. If does not it will result in a loss
7. If player does not have suit to play they can use a **trump** card which will result in them winning unless another player is able to use a higher **trump** card
8. Having the highest card or highest **trump** in play secures one pack once everyone is able to throw down a card
9. To determine who starts the next potential pack the winner of the last pack goes first and moves in a clockwise fashion
10. Winner is determined once the team that needs to makes the required packs or if the team that won the Kitty defends other team from making required packs by everyone playing out their whole hand. 

## Vision
Trumps is an iconic game in Hawaii and is currently played in all generations as a card game for competitveness. This game can potentially be turned into a type of comptetive gambling game that can be like the new poker. It is more small scaled and I feel it is possible to implement an online version/web based application that allows users to take a gamble with a random partner to be able to win more money or prizes. Just a vision for this but could be impossible as well
